# Task 1: Iris Dataset EDA & Visualization

## 🎯 Objective
Perform basic exploratory data analysis on the Iris flower dataset and visualize relationships among features.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Built-in `seaborn` dataset.
- Features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, species.

## 🔍 Analysis Steps
- Loaded the dataset and checked dimensions, types, and summary statistics.
- Created:
  - Scatter plot (sepal vs petal length, colored by species)
  - Histograms for distribution of each feature
  - Box plots to detect outliers and ranges

## 📈 Key Observations
- Strong correlation between petal length and sepal length.
- Petal size of setosa species is significantly smaller.
- Sepal width is more variable across species.

## 📁 Structure
- `iris_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with EDA and plots.
- `README.md`: Project overview and findings.
